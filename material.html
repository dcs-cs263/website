<p>Cyber Security is about identifying vulnerabilities in systems, exploiting them, and defending against them. This encompasses software, hardware, physical, and social systems. This module is approached differently than many other Computer Science modules in that we explore a range of topics <em>through examples</em> of vulnerabilities and show how to mitigate them. The goal for you is to become able to extrapolate ideas from these examples.</p>

<p>Although not strictly prerequisites for this module, you should be familiar with basic aspects of computer security (e.g. CS140) and low-level programming (e.g. CS132). </p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-unlock-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> Confidentiality & Use of Encryption</h3>

<p>Materials for Cyber Security must not be shared outside of the Department of Computer Science. Furthermore, all materials are encrypted and the corresponding decryption key must be obtained for each resource. To decrypt a resource, you may use the following shell script where <code>FILENAME</code> is the name of the encrypted file, <code>PASSWORD</code> is the password, and <code>OUTPUT</code> is the name that should be given to the decrypted file:</p>

<pre>
$ openssl enc -in FILENAME -d -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:PASSWORD -md md5 > OUTPUT
</pre>

<p>Access to confidential files is restricted by different security clearances. To obtain a particular security clearance you must pass certification:</p>

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Access Level</th>
            <th>Certification test</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>OFFICIAL</td>
          <td>-</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

<h3><i class="fab fa-slack" aria-hidden="true"></i> Slack</h3>

<p>There is a Slack team for this module which represents the primary method of communication for this module. Although important information will be communicated via email, you are strongly encouraged to sign up for the Slack with your <code>@warwick.ac.uk</code> email address at <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/dcs-cs263/signup">https://join.slack.com/t/dcs-cs263/signup</a>. You can use this to ask questions during lectures, about the coursework, the labs, or Cyber Security more generally. For all this, you can choose to remain anonymous as well as we do not require you to sign up with your name. Indeed, you are encouraged to come up with a suitable cover identity.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-presentation"></i> Security Briefings</h3>

<p>Security briefings are held twice weekly in Term 1 and interactive. You are encouraged to join live for them, although recordings will be made available afterwards.</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-head-vr"></i> Cyber Warfare Simulations &amp; Training</h3>

<p>Training sessions take place on Mondays at 4pm, Tuesdays at 12pm, Wednesdays at 11am, Thursdays at 1pm, and Fridays at 11am and 12pm. There are no sessions in Week 1 and the first is on the Monday in Week 2. You are free to join any two groups through Tabula, but try to keep numbers evenly balanced.</p>

<p>In addition to the above Cyber Warfare Simulations, there are plenty of extra Cyber Security exercises available on the internet, which are linked to below. There are also frequent CTF events run by various companies and organisations which take place throughout the year and I will try to advertise those to you when possible.</p>
